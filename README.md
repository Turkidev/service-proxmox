# Proxmox integration for WemX
Start selling Proxmox VMs using WemX

Users can buy a VM and WemX will create it using the API, in addition WemX will create a user account on the Proxmox panel and give the user access to manage their server directly on the Proxmox Panel.

Manage power actions from WemX, such as start, stop, shutdown and reboot the VM. WemX also displays the resources being used by the VM such as Memory, disk space, CPU etc...
